### 🚀 About Me & Academic Background

I am a **3rd-year Computer Engineering student** at **Eskişehir Technical University** (100% English Curriculum) with a strong focus on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Autonomous Systems**. Unlike a traditional engineer, I combine my technical skills with strong communication and management abilities gained from my previous degree in **Social Media Management** (High Honor Graduate).

My passion lies in bridging the gap between **software algorithms** and the **physical world**. I don't just write code; I deploy it on drones, embedded systems, and real-world applications.

### 💼 Professional Experience & Leadership

Here is how I apply my skills in the field:

* **🚁 Founder & Team Lead @ [KAYIUAVTEAM]:**
    * Leading a multidisciplinary team to compete in **SUAS 2026**.
    * Developing autonomous flight algorithms and **"Search, Detect, Deliver"** missions using Computer Vision.
    * Managing both the software architecture and the mechanical operations as the **Chief Pilot**.

* **📢 Official Youth Leader @ Ministry of Youth and Sports (GSB):**
    * Actively volunteering since 2022 in major NGOs like **TEMA, Kızılay, and Yeşilay**.
    * Organizing social responsibility projects (village school visits, aid distribution) and leading youth camps.
    * Combining technical discipline with social leadership and crisis management skills.

* **🎓 Instructor & Mentor:**
    * Teaching **Drone Piloting, 3D Printing, and Simulation** at private institutions (e.g., Özel Sakarya Schools).
    * Mentored international students in **Romania, Bulgaria, Austria, and Kosovo** during the Summer of 2025 on AI & Technology.
